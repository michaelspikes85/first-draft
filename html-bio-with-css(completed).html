          My name is Michael Spikes, I am 34 years old. I live in Guyton,
          Georgia with my wife Samantha, 13 year old Kage, and 4 year old
          Legend. I currently work at Rockstar Energy as a Sales Representative.

        <p class="short-para">
          I am currently enrolled in the Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp. Here I
          will learn HTML, CSS, Javascript and the framework and server side
          material that goes along with them. I am taking this course to secure
          my family's future with a skill that will stay relavent, is
          fulfilling, a good paycheck, and give me the potential to work from
          home.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a number of hobbies that range across the board. I have always
          been a big fan of video games, mostly RPGs. Disc Golf is one of my
          favorite outdoor sports. I am also a blacksmith that specializes in
          blades. I am a huge hockey fan, and even bigger Pittsburgh Penguins
          fan. My most prised pocessions with the exception of my family are my:
          2016 Toyota Tundra, 2006 Kawasaki Brute Force 750, Blacksmith shop,
          and a signed Marc-Andre Fleury Pittsburgh Penguins Jersey. I have 2
          snakes, Pixels and Willadean (named after my mother because she hates
          snakes).
